Scepix is a multi-platform pixel-based physics sandbox game heavily inspired from other games like The Powder Toy and Sandboxels.

This is my first real attempt at creating an application using the Avalonia UI framework as well as the MVVM model so the code is kinda shitty.

Feel free to look through the source code, fork or just play the game. I plan to work more on it but it's mainly just a test app to improve my skills so don't expect consistant updates.

Anyway thanks for reading!
